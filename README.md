# Water Segmentation

![Example of Water Segmentation](https://example.com/water_segmentation_example.png)

Water Segmentation is a project aimed at segmenting water bodies such as lakes, pools, rivers, etc., from images using YOLOv8 and Roboflow.

## Features

- Automatic detection and segmentation of water bodies in images.
- Customizable and extensible architecture built on YOLOv8.
- Easily deployable for various applications including environmental monitoring, urban planning, and more.

## Requirements
The Entire project is worked in the pycharm environment. Before using this project, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

- YOLO Pre-trained Weights
- Roboflow
- Pycharm 
- Custom Water Dataset from Roboflow
- GPU (for high quality results)

Required Dependencies such as : 
* ultralytics

## Customization
The steps below can be used to adapt the YOLO model for particular object classes:

- A dataset of your object classes with labeled annotations should be gathered.

- Utilizing your dataset, create a unique YOLO model specifically for water segmentation. 

## Performance
The system has been optimized for real-time performance, particularly when a GPU is used. However, actual performance may vary depending on your system configuration and the task's complexity. To attain the greatest results, consider fine-tuning the system for your individual use case.
